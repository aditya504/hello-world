Hi team, 

I had power issue at my home, so I had to connect through my mobile. The network is bad here. 

regarding the connection issue task, I don't have access to datafactory to check the connection while I make some changes in the pipeline.

The connection variables are fine, I've done the variablizing changes to the pipeline, suggested by dinesh, and also I've some other changes too. It didn't worked out well. I need to connect with dinesh and Manikandan to work on this issue further and to get access to datafactory for testing it.
